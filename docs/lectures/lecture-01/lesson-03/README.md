After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Illustrate how hashing works.
* Describe what a digital signature is.
* Explain digital signatures use private and public keys.
* Identify the benefits of using hashing and digital signatures in Cardano.

To learn more about the topics covered in this lesson, we encourage you to review the following resources:

* [How Does the Blockchain Use Hashes?](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/8657/how-does-the-blockchain-use-hashes)
* [Why Cardano: Signatures](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/signatures/)
* [Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/edwards-curve-digital-signature-algorithm-eddsa)

## Collaborate with the Pioneers Community

Remember that you can interact with the participants of the PPP through the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by joining the channels under the Plutus Pioneers category.

If during the program you have questions about Plutus, we invite you to share them at [Cardano Stack Exchange (CSE)](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) by adding the `plutus-pioneer-program` tag to your question. The IOG's Education Team members will monitor these questions to support your learning journey. Whenever you share a question at CSE, you're helping to build up the Cardano and Plutus development knowledge base.
