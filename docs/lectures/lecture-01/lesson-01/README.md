## Collaborate with the Pioneers Community

Remember that you can interact with the participants of the PPP through the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by joining the channels under the Plutus Pioneers category.

If during the program you have questions about Plutus, we invite you to share them at [Cardano Stack Exchange (CSE)](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) by adding the `plutus-pioneer-program` tag to your question. The IOG's Education Team members will monitor these questions to support your learning journey. Whenever you share a question at CSE, you're helping to build up the Cardano and Plutus development knowledge base.
