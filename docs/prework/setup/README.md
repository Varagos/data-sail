# Working Environment Set Up

To follow up on this program's activities, you should set up your working environment to start successfully since the first lesson.

In this program, you'll extensively use Plutus to create Cardano applications. You can use a web development environment like [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) or set up a local working environment on your computer.

The web development environment allows you to create a Cardano application from your browser, and no further installations are required. This is a suitable option if you have a reliable internet connection.

To set up a local environment, we provide a Docker container image that will install all the required libraries and dependencies. We recommend this option if your internet connection speed is lower than 10 Mbit/s.

We provide detailed instructions to set up your working environment in the following guides:

* [Using Demeter](demeter.md): This guide shows how to set up an account to use demeter.run and how to set up the environment required for this course.

* [Using Docker](docker.md): This guide shows you how to use the provided Docker image to set up a local working environment.
