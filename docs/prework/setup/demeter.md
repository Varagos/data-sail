### Create a demeter.run project

After setting up your account, you are ready to start building a Cardano application on demeter.run. To do so, follow the instructions below to create a new project.

1. On the "Project" page, click on the "NEW PROJECT" button, as seen in the image below.

2. Next, you'll need to follow the required steps to set up a new project. First, you need to choose an organization where your project will reside. By default, an organization with your username exists. We'll select the default organization for this demo, as shown in the image below, where the username is `jarturomora`. After choosing the organization, click on the "NEXT" button.

3. In the second step, you need to choose the location of the cluster that you'll use. As for now, only a US-based cluster exists. So, select the "US Central" cluster and click the "NEXT" button to continue, as the image below shows.

4. After choosing a cluster, the next step is to select a plan. For the purpose of the program, we will use the "Discover" plan that is available free of charge. So, select the "Discover" plan and click on the "NEXT" button to continue, as the image below shows.

5. Next, you need to choose a network for your project. For testing purposes, we'll typically use the "Preview" networks. Select the "Preview" network and click the "NEXT" button to continue, as the image below shows.

6. The last step is to provide a name for your project. Also, in this step, you can review the project's details; be aware that you can have only one project in the Discover plan. In this demo, the project was named "PPP Demo." So, set a name for your project and click on the "CREATE PROJECT" button to finish, as the image below shows.

That's it! In the forthcoming lessons of the program, you'll learn how to start using your brand new demeter.run project to begin building Cardano applications.

If you have any questions, recall that you can reach the PPP community on the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by checking out the `#pioneers-questions` channel.
